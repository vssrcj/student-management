## Student Learning Management System

*Made by CJ*

This app is made with Node, Express, and SQLite.

I chose this stack, because it is light weight, the database is embedded, and most devs have Node installed on their machines.

I made this on the [Cozy tutorial](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-tutorial) boilerplate.
It is a great resource if you want to set up a db with an API quickly.

### Get up and running

Firstly, initiate the app with:
```
npm install
```

Then, run it:
```
npm start
```

This will create a database named `cozy` in your working directory, and the server will startup at http://localhost:9250
